# Step 3: Manual Test for Azure IoT Edge on device

This section walks you through the test to be performed on the Edge devices running the Linux operating system such that it can qualify for Azure IoT Edge certification.

<a name="Step-3-1-IoTEdgeRunTime"></a>
## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed or at the point of distribution on the device to customer(s):

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

*Edge Runtime Enabled:*

**Check the iotedge daemon command:** 

Open the command prompt on your IoT Edge device , confirm that the Azure IoT edge Daemon is under running state

    systemctl status iotedge
